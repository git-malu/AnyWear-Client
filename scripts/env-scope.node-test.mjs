// #163: an environment-scope guard for workflow configuration.
//
// The defect class: a job reads a configuration name that is configured at
// environment scope while the job declares no `environment`, so GitHub resolves
// it as empty and the failure only surfaces at the credentialed step. Client hit
// the same class as Infra and E2E. The fix was at the configuration layer
// (repository-scoped variables, no stale beta switch); this file makes the
// structure that prevented the defect visible in source, so a regression fails
// `pnpm run test:run` instead of the next release.
//
// The text is sliced without a YAML dependency, in the same style as the other
// repository source guards.
