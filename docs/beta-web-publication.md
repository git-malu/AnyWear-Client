# Beta web publication

AnyWear-Client exposes two workflow entries: the automatic
[`check.yml`](../.github/workflows/check.yml) and the manual
[`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml). `release.yml` is the only
publication surface. Its `operation` input currently offers exactly one value,
`release`, and the chain inside it is `build` → `verify` → `deploy` → `record`.

`build.yml`, `test.yml` and `browser.yml` are `workflow_call` implementations of
`check.yml`. They are not entries and have no dispatch surface.

| Entry | Trigger | Manual | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `check.yml` | push / pull request to `main` | no | Build, unit tests, mocked browser integration |
| `release.yml` | `workflow_dispatch` (`operation: release`) | yes | Build, verify, deploy and record the Beta web client |

## The declared interface

`VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` and `VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`
are compiled into the bundle. The `build` job holds no AWS credential, so it
cannot resolve them from CloudFormation or SSM. The dispatch therefore declares
them as three required string inputs:

| Input | Compiled variable |
| --- | --- |
| `api_base_url` | `VITE_API_BASE_URL` |
| `cognito_user_pool_id` | `VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` |
| `cognito_client_id` | `VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` |

The inputs are the reviewed interface for that run, and they are part of the
dispatch event rather than mutable configuration the run cannot see. A
repository variable would let the interface change between dispatch and deploy
without appearing in the run's record; a required input cannot be omitted, and
the value that was approved is the value the run carries.

`pnpm build` runs `scripts/write-build-metadata.mjs` in the same environment Vite
compiles, so `dist/build-metadata.json` records **exactly** the values that were
built. The file keeps `source_commit` with its previous value and meaning and
adds the interface values under schema version 2. A missing or malformed
interface value fails the build instead of recording metadata for an interface
that was never compiled.

## Jobs and credentials

| Job | `environment` | `id-token: write` | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `build` | — | no | Checks out the exact source SHA, installs, builds the assets and `dist/build-metadata.json`, uploads `dist/` as an artifact |
| `verify` | — | no | Publication identity check; recorded interface against the dispatch inputs; compiled assets contain the recorded values; unit tests; mocked browser tests |
| `deploy` | `beta` | yes | The only credential boundary: OIDC assumption of the dedicated publish role, STS principal check, live interface resolution, mismatch refusal, S3 sync, CloudFront invalidation, publication record |
| `record` | — | no | Validates the publication record, writes the step summary, uploads the validated record artifact |

`deploy` runs `needs: verify`, so no role is assumed and no AWS API is called
before verification completes. `build` and `verify` have no `environment`, no
`id-token: write` and no AWS step. The `verify` job downloads the artifact the
`build` job uploaded and runs the same credential-free identity check again in
`deploy` before the first AWS call, so a tampered artifact cannot reach the
credentialed step.

The `verify` identity check pins the original repository and repository id,
`refs/heads/main`, `workflow_dispatch`, the exact `release.yml` workflow ref,
`GITHUB_SHA` equality between workflow and source, the Beta account
(`650880818323`) and region (`ap-east-1`), the dedicated
`beta-client-publish-role` ARN, and the Actions run/attempt identity. A
different value anywhere fails the run before any publication action.

## Live-interface comparison

Before writing anything, `deploy` resolves the live Beta interface:

| Value | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `ClientBucketName`, `ClientDistributionId` | `AnyWearPlatformStack-beta` outputs |
| `ApiBaseUrl` | `AnyWearPlatformStack-beta` outputs, the API distribution's domain |
| user pool id, client id | `/anywear/beta/cognito_user_pool_id`, `/anywear/beta/cognito_client_id` |

The whole table is one `DescribeStacks` read of `AnyWearPlatformStack-beta` — the
Beta `Base` stack that owns both CloudFront distributions — plus the two SSM
parameters; the release path reads no other stack.

It compares each value with the interface recorded in
`dist/build-metadata.json` and exits before `aws s3 sync` or the CloudFront
invalidation when any value differs. The comparison is a refusal, not a
warning: a drifted live interface needs a new dispatch that declares the new
values and builds a bundle for them.

## Publication record

After the sync and invalidation, `deploy` writes
`publication/publication-record.json` containing the source SHA, run id and
attempt, bucket, distribution, invalidation id, the resolved interface values and
a timestamp, and uploads it as the `client-publication-record` artifact. The
`record` job downloads that artifact, validates the record against the same
repository/workflow/run identity, writes the step summary and uploads the
validated record as `client-publication-record-validated`. `record` has no
environment and no OIDC token; recording cannot acquire a credential.

## Repository configuration

The stage switch was renamed with no compatibility fallback: `release.yml` reads
`vars.ENABLE_BETA_MUTATION` and never `ENABLE_BETA_DEPLOY`. The repository
variable must be renamed out of band; until it is, the `build` job's condition is
false and every job is skipped.

| Beta variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ENABLE_BETA_MUTATION` | `true` to enable the manual release; `false` skips the whole chain |
| `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` | `650880818323` |
| `AWS_REGION` | `ap-east-1` |
| `CLIENT_PUBLISH_ROLE_ARN` | `arn:aws:iam::650880818323:role/beta-client-publish-role` |

Infra owns the dedicated role. It needs `DescribeStacks` on
`AnyWearPlatformStack-beta`, the Beta `Base` stack the release path reads,
`GetParameter` on the two Cognito parameters, `ListBucket` and object
`GetObject`/`PutObject`/`DeleteObject` on the existing Client bucket, and
`CreateInvalidation` on its distribution. It cannot deploy CDK/CFN, assume
infrastructure deployment roles or push Service images. Missing role
configuration fails before AWS access; there is no shared-role fallback.

Read back the environment's actual protection rules and branch policy before
activation. Use supported environment protections and a `main` branch policy;
record provider limitations and operational coordination where needed. An
environment named `beta` alone does not prove configured protections. Source
delivery does not provision the role or configure those protections.

## Running a release

1. Select the reviewed Client revision on `main` and dispatch `release.yml` from
   that branch with `operation: release` and the three declared interface values.
   Publication has no migration window token, issue-comment URL or deadline
   inputs. Release coordination belongs in the publication record, rather than a
   permanent dependency on an Issue or receipt.
2. `build` produces the assets and metadata from that exact SHA, and `verify`
   checks publication identity, the declared interface, the compiled assets, the
   unit suite and the mocked browser suite.
3. `deploy` resolves the live interface and refuses on any mismatch. On a match
   it syncs the built assets, requests a CloudFront invalidation and writes the
   publication record.
4. Read the record artifact and step summary for the source, bucket,
   distribution, invalidation id and resolved interface. Confirm invalidation
   completion and observe the served `build-metadata.json` Client SHA and
   interface values. An upload or invalidation request alone is not runtime
   qualification; `AnyWear-E2E` qualifies the actual deployed Client, Service
   components and Infra tuple.

The `beta-client-publish` concurrency group serializes Client publication and
does not cancel an active upload. It is local to this repository, independently
of Infra's deployment queue. Coordinate conflicting maintenance/deployment
operations and verify prior jobs/cloud operations finish before changing
ownership. Disabling the stage switch does not revoke a job's existing
configuration snapshot or stop an already-started upload. A retry or recovery
uses the ordinary release entry and the same identity/build/live-interface
verification; no new scheduling token is required.

## Migration status

The [revised AnyWear #54 plan](https://github.com/git-malu/AnyWear/issues/54#issuecomment-6059823426)
uses one explicitly authorized Beta maintenance stop, migration and restart. The
initial Infra reconciliation retains the running Client until an independent
Client selection is published. Old `CLIENT_PUBLISH_WINDOW_*` variables are unused
by this workflow and can be removed during authorized configuration
reconciliation. Role provisioning, effective old-authority retirement, actual
independent publication and final E2E remain runtime delivery evidence, separate
from this source change. This entry-consolidation change was neither dispatched
nor deployed.
