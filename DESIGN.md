# AnyWear Client Design System

The design system of the AnyWear Client, a Tauri build of the AnyWear wardrobe and virtual
try-on app for desktop and mobile. It covers the auth routes (`/login`, `/register`,
`/verify`), `/dashboard`, `/wardrobe`, `/mirror`, `/settings`, and their shared shells.

This document states the system the source defines, and it is the input to UI work. A
defect in the shipped UI belongs in a GitHub issue, not in this file.

## Overview

AnyWear is a quiet, light interface built around wardrobe and try-on photography: white
cards on gray page surfaces, dark gray text, compact controls, restrained feedback, and no
decoration that competes with the clothing.

- **Imagery carries the color.** Surfaces stay near-neutral so garments, base photos, and
  generated results supply the visual focus. Image and action hierarchy outranks any change
  to the primary color.
- **One light palette.** The system defines no dark variant, no theme switch, and no
  persisted theme preference.
- **Few color roles.** Indigo marks primary action, input focus, and image or outfit
  selection; red marks failure and destructive actions; yellow processing, blue pending,
  amber and green credit levels.
- **Text and inline SVG carry the identity.** "AnyWear" renders as text in
  [AuthLayout](src/layouts/AuthLayout.tsx) and [MainLayout](src/layouts/MainLayout.tsx).
  There is no logo component and no icon library: icons are inline SVG, emoji, or text.
- **Tailwind utilities only.** [index.css](src/index.css) imports Tailwind and sets the body
  defaults; there are no CSS modules and no component stylesheet.

## Colors

[index.css](src/index.css) imports Tailwind with `@import "tailwindcss";`, and
[vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts) uses the Tailwind Vite plugin; [pnpm-lock.yaml](pnpm-lock.yaml)
pins **4.3.3**. There is no project `@theme`, no semantic custom color variable, and no
dark palette. The `--color-*` variables are framework defaults; the `colors` map in this
file's front matter restates the ones the system uses under documentation role names.

The body declares the literals `background-color: #f9fafb` and `color: #111827`. They are
separate from `bg-gray-50` and `text-gray-900`, whose v4 defaults are OKLCH. Use the pinned
default theme's own representation; do not substitute a v3 hex value.

| Role | Utility | Value (v4.3.3 default) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth surface | `bg-gray-50` | `oklch(98.5% 0.002 247.839)` |

| Primary action | `bg-indigo-600`, hover `bg-indigo-700` | `oklch(51.1% 0.262 276.966)`, `oklch(45.7% 0.24 277.023)` |
| Selection and focus | `*-indigo-500` | `oklch(58.5% 0.233 277.117)` |
| Selected tint | `bg-indigo-50` | `oklch(96.2% 0.018 272.314)` |

| Input border | `border-gray-300` | `oklch(87.2% 0.01 258.338)` |
| Destructive action | `bg-red-600`, hover `bg-red-700` | `oklch(57.7% 0.245 27.325)`, `oklch(50.5% 0.213 27.518)` |

| Processing badge | `bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800` | `oklch(97.3% 0.071 103.193)` / `oklch(47.6% 0.114 61.907)` |
| Pending badge | `bg-blue-100 text-blue-800` | `oklch(93.2% 0.032 255.585)` / `oklch(42.4% 0.199 265.638)` |
| Low credits | `bg-amber-100 text-amber-800`, icon `text-amber-500` | `oklch(96.2% 0.059 95.617)` / `oklch(47.3% 0.137 46.201)` / `oklch(76.9% 0.188 70.08)` |
| Credits available | `bg-green-100 text-green-800`, icon `text-green-500` | `oklch(96.2% 0.044 156.743)` / `oklch(44.8% 0.119 151.328)` / `oklch(72.3% 0.219 149.579)` |

Status is never carried by color alone: every colored badge or message states its condition
in text.

## Typography

The body stack is `Inter, system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`, declared in
[index.css](src/index.css). Inter is a preferred family name only: no bundled font,
`@font-face`, or download is configured, so the face depends on the host's installed fonts.
There is no display face and no project type token.

| Utility | Size / default line height | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text-xs` | 0.75rem / 1rem | Metadata, credit and history badges, mobile navigation, prompt counter |
| `text-sm` | 0.875rem / 1.25rem | Controls, helper text, history and outfit labels |
| `text-base` | 1rem / 1.5rem | Add-item action text below `sm` |
| `text-lg` | 1.125rem / 1.75rem | Mirror, settings, and outfit-editor titles (`font-semibold`); auth and Add/Details titles (`font-medium leading-6`) |
| `text-xl` | 1.25rem / 1.75rem | Main brand (`font-bold`), loading and error headings (`font-semibold`), outfit heading |
| `text-2xl` | 1.5rem / 2rem | Mirror and wardrobe page headings (`font-bold`) |
| `text-3xl` | 1.875rem / 2.25rem | Auth brand and profile-sync failure (`font-extrabold`) |
| `text-4xl` | 2.25rem / 2.5rem | Weather temperature (`font-bold`) |
| `text-5xl` | 3rem / 3rem | Weather emoji |

Weights in use are 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800. Three local exceptions exist and define no
new scale: `leading-relaxed` with `line-clamp-2` for weather advice, `uppercase
tracking-wider` for popular-city chips, and `text-[10px] leading-none` for the remove-image
control.

## Layout

Spacing follows Tailwind's default `--spacing` of **0.25rem**: `1` 0.25rem, `1.5` 0.375rem,
`2` 0.5rem, `3` 0.75rem, `4` 1rem, `6` 1.5rem, `8` 2rem, `12` 3rem. Half steps appear in the
Mirror mode switch and the try-on action.

| Area | Layout |
| --- | --- |
| Auth shell | `min-h-screen`, centered column, `py-12 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`; form `sm:max-w-md` (28rem); white card `py-8 px-4 sm:px-10` |
| App shell | `min-h-screen bg-gray-100`; top bar `h-16`; nav `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`; main `flex-1 px-4 py-6` |
| Mirror | `space-y-8`; input sections `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6`; white `rounded-lg p-6 shadow` cards |
| Wardrobe | grids `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5` |
| Settings and dashboard | Settings `max-w-lg` (32rem) centered with `space-y-8` and `p-6` cards; dashboard `space-y-6`, details `sm:grid-cols-3` |
| Wardrobe dialogs | fixed `inset-0`: Add/Details `z-10` with `sm:max-w-lg shadow-xl`; outfit dialogs `z-50` with `max-w-lg w-full p-6` |

Main content runs full width to its maximum. Image proportions are fixed by role: garment
and base-photo frames use `aspect-[4/5]` with `object-cover`; history thumbnails keep 3:4;
generated results use a `max-h-[70vh] object-contain` area.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth comes from Tailwind's default shadow scale and a small z-index set. There is no
project elevation token.

| Utility | Default shadow | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shadow` / `shadow-sm` | `0 1px 3px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 1px 2px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)` | Cards and widgets |
| `shadow-md` | `0 4px 6px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 2px 4px -2px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)` | Wardrobe card hover |
| `shadow-xl` | `0 20px 25px -5px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 8px 10px -6px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)` | Dialog panels |

Wardrobe cards gain `hover:shadow-md`. Overlays stack in three bands: `z-10` for the
Add/Details dialogs, `z-50` for outfit dialogs, the full-page loading overlay, and the
history image viewer. These three shadows are the whole elevation system; the document
format defines no token group for elevation, so it stays in prose.

## Shapes

Controls use `rounded-md` (0.375rem), cards and dialogs `rounded-lg` (0.5rem), modal panels
`rounded-xl` (0.75rem), and pills or circular controls `rounded-full`. Borders are 1px
(`border`); selected photos and items use `border-2`; selection adds `ring-1` or `ring-2`.

Border and ring color has no component sub-token in the document format, which accepts
`backgroundColor`, `textColor`, `typography`, `rounded`, `padding`, `size`, `height`, and
`width`. Those colors therefore stay here: `border-gray-200` for skeletons,
`border-gray-300` for inputs, and the `*-indigo-500` selection and focus family from
[Colors](#colors).

## Components

The system defines styling for these reusable pieces. It is not a component library: there
is no generic `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Badge`, or `Modal` component, and each screen
composes the utilities below.

| Piece | Styling |
| --- | --- |
| Primary action | `bg-indigo-600 text-white rounded-md`, hover `bg-indigo-700`; busy or unavailable states use native `disabled` with `disabled:opacity-50` and change the label |
| Secondary action | White surface with a gray border, paired with the primary action |
| Destructive action | `bg-red-600 text-white rounded-md`, hover `bg-red-700` |
| Card | `bg-white rounded-lg shadow`, `p-6` for page-level cards; `hover:shadow-md` where the card is a link or tile |
| History card actions | `bg-black/50` overlay over the whole card, revealed by pointer hover or by focus within the overlay itself; the actions stay in the tab order and the accessibility tree while hidden, and Delete keeps the overlay visible while it swaps the action set in place for a confirmation (`Yes, Delete` / `Cancel`) rather than opening a dialog |
| Dialog panel | White surface, `rounded-xl shadow-xl`, `z-10` for Add/Details and `z-50` for outfit dialogs and the history image viewer, whose panel is the image itself; dismissed by backdrop click and Escape, with focus moved into the panel on open and restored to the control that opened it on close |
| Text input | White surface with `border-gray-300` and `rounded-md`; focus moves the border and ring color to indigo |
| Status badge | `rounded-full` pill with `text-xs`, one of the pending, processing, or failed pairs from [Colors](#colors), always paired with text |
| Selection card | `aspect-[4/5]` image with `rounded-lg`; unselected uses a gray border, selected uses an indigo border with `ring` and a text label |
| Credit pill | `rounded-full px-3 py-1.5 text-sm font-medium`, colored by remaining balance: green above 2, amber at 1–2, red at 0 |
| Error message | `text-red-500` for field and inline errors; `role="alert"` for a failure the user must notice |
| Rating control | Five stars in a `div` with `role="radiogroup"` named Rate this result, each star a `button` with `role="radio"` and `aria-checked`; one tab stop with arrow-key selection; the focused star paints a 2px indigo ring (`focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-indigo-500`); filled stars use `text-indigo-500` and outline stars `text-gray-300`, and the sentence uses `text-sm text-gray-600`. A read-only rating is text (`Your rating: N/5`) with the stars as decoration. |

The History card actions row costs a second Components entry for one surface and restates
Tailwind's `focus-within` and `group-hover` utilities instead of naming a project token. It is
recorded because the reveal is the component's new interaction state, and an undocumented
interaction state is the larger cost.

Focus is `focus:ring-2` with an indigo ring, usually with `focus:ring-offset-2`, defined
per control rather than inherited from a shared component. A ring color without a ring
width is not a focus treatment.

Motion uses Tailwind's defaults: `transition-*` utilities at 150ms with `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0,
0.2, 1)`, plus `animate-spin` for busy spinners and `animate-pulse` for skeletons. No custom
duration, easing, or animation library is defined.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do keep garment, base-photo, and result imagery as the loudest element on every screen.
- Do reserve indigo for primary action, focus, and selection, and keep the status pairs
  meaningful and text-labelled.
- Do list a design token only when source resolves to its value. A proposed palette, font,
  scale, or geometry is not part of this system until it ships.
- Do record a framework default in its native representation, including OKLCH where the
  pinned default theme uses OKLCH.
- Do keep the fixed image proportions: `aspect-[4/5]` covers for garments and base photos,
  contain for generated results.
- Do pair every colored state with text, because color alone does not carry the meaning.
- Don't describe a role such as "primary action" as a CSS custom property. The project
  declares no `@theme` layer, and the token layer is documentation.
- Don't add a color, font, spacing step, or radius without a source definition in the same
  change.
- Don't claim WCAG conformance, measured contrast, or device parity from source inspection
  alone.
- Don't move a defect into this document. Fix it, or track it in a GitHub issue.
